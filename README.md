# Helix Tools

## Introduction

This repository contains tools to process assets in [HelixJS](https://github.com/DerSchmale/helixjs/). The web-based 
tools can be ran on [github pages](https://derschmale.github.io/helixjs-tools/). If you want to adapt the code and need 
to build, go to the tool's subdirectory and run the following commands:

```
npm install
gulp
```
